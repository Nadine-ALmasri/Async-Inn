# Async-Inn
## Summary 
The project involves building a web-based API for a hotel chain called "Async Inn." The goal is to create a system that allows the management of hotel assets such as locations, rooms, and amenities. The existing manual process of maintaining data through spreadsheets and binders is time-consuming and costly. The API will provide a more efficient way to handle the assets, allowing for easy modification and management.
